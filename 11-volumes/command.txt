🧪 Summary:
Step	                                              Result
Volume doesn't exist	                              Docker creates it
Volume is empty + path in image has content	          Docker copies contents from image → volume
Volume already exists	                              Docker uses as-is (no copy happens)


Case	                                                What happens
Volume is empty, mount to image path	                Image contents copied to volume (once)
Volume already has files	                            Volume contents override image files
Image’s original index.html visible?	                ❌ No — hidden by volume
Want original back?	                                    You must delete the volume and recreate it
