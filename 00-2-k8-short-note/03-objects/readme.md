## Pods

- **each pods can have multiple containers**
- **pods running = at least one container is running**
- **containers in a pod and communicate via localhost**
- **kubelet is the process that watch and take care of pods in the worker node**
- **Pods are immutable after creation**

## Replicasets

### Shortcomings

- **Manual Update Required**
- **Not a replacement for manual scaling**
- **Lack of Rolling Updates**

## Deployments

![Deployment](./images/deployment.png)

- **Deployment is a higher-level abstraction over ReplicaSets and builds on top of ReplicaSets.**
- **Advanced features**

  - **Rolling Updates**
  - **Rollback**
  - **Scaling**
  - **Declarative Updates**

- **In Kubernetes, Deployments detect changes to their Pod template by computing a hash. If the template changes, Kubernetes automatically triggers a rolling update, replacing the old pods with new ones. This is the change-detection mechanism.**

## Services

- **provide stable Ip or DNS to route traffic to pods**

## Services types

### Cluster Ip service

- **default type**
- **exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP**
- **only accessible from within the cluster**

## NodePort service

- **exposes the service on each Node’s IP**
- **a ClusterIP service is automatically created and is accessible only from within the cluster**
- **ClusterIP + NodePort**

## ExternalName

- **Maps the service to external DNS name**
- **use to redirect traffic to outside the cluster**
- **ExternalName Services rely on CNAMEs/DNS resolution**

---

**🛑 🛑 Service DNS resolution works with just the service name only if the sender and the service are in the same namespace. Otherwise, you must use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).**

## 🛑 How kube proxy routes requests

- **each node has one kube proxy**
- **steps**

  1. **Service is just a definition**
  2. **kube-proxy on every node watches for Services**
     - kube-proxy constantly watches the API server for:
       - Service objects
       - Endpoint objects (list of pod IPs that match the Service selector)
  3. **kube-proxy installs routing rules**
     - These rules say:
       - “If traffic comes to ClusterIP:Port → send it to one of these pod IPs”.
  4. **Pod can be anywhere**
     - If the chosen pod is on:
       - Same node → traffic stays local.
       - Different node → kube-proxy routes it through the cluster network to that node’s pod.
  5. **You never “talk to” kube-proxy directly**
     - You connect to the ClusterIP (the virtual IP assigned to the Service).
     - kube-proxy is working in the background on each node to ensure packets are forwarded to the right pod.

## 🛑 Does a Service Belong to One Node?

No — a Service in Kubernetes does not belong to any single node.

**Why?**

- A Service is a cluster-wide resource stored in the Kubernetes API server.
- not tied to any particular node.
- 🛑 All kube-proxy instances on all nodes are aware of every Service and set up the necessary routing rules.

## 🛑 Services are virtual; kube-proxy uses a routing table to forward pod requests to matching pods via the Service’s IP.
